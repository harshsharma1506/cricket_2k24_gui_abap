## ABAP version 
7.4 

## Suggestions to optimize the current code 

So, at few places I wasn't able to use the ABAP magic which comes in 7.5. 
Hence, there is one loop in the code to calculate the target match that could be done via a select from itab as well 

```abap
"instead of below
LOOP AT g_it_final INTO ls_final_ba_wick.     " in 7.4 +, you can use select sum ( ) from itab
            lv_target_match1 = lv_target_match1 + ls_final_ba_wick-individual_score
ENDLOOP.

"we could have it via
SELECT SINGLE SUM( individual_score ) FROM @g_it_final as itab
      WHERE action = 'Batting'.
```

For , summing as well, new sum operator can be use for incremental sum.
